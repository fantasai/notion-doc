\subsection{The dock}

Generally, if you want to use some panel application like the xfce4-panel, 
fbpanel or the gnome-panel, use an embedded dock. When used in this way, it is
common to add only one panel to the dock and have it span the entire width of 
the screen. However, the dock does support adding multiple applications to it,
so if you prefer WindowMaker-style dockapps, \file{mod\_dock} (either embedded
or floating) is also the way to go.
