This package contains some (advanced user and module writer)
documentation for the Ion window manager.

You will need to install latex2html to build the HTML documents.

How to build:

 1. Modify TOPDIR in Makefile point to your top-level Ion source
    directory, containing a working system.mk (or system-ac.mk).

 3. After the above has been done, you may run 'make all' to build the
    (hyperlinked) DVI and HTML versions of the documents. You may have
    increase TeX pool size.

 4. If you want Postcript versions of the documents, run 'make all-ps'.
    For PDF you need to have dvipdfm installed. The PDF:s are obviously
    built with 'make all-pdf'.
